<u>Amount of Time Spent</u>

So to start I would like to say this took me over two hours. It was really not that difficult of a task however I am a perfectionist and I spent a good amount of time trying to design a system that I felt was easy to understand. I probably spent a total of 4 hours with most of the time going toward refactoring logic to files and functions that I felt where appropriate.

<u>Big O</u>

I worst case for my program is O(N) where N is the number of data points I was given. I iterate through equivalently sized lists a constant number of times and all house keeping is done using dictionaries which has constant insert and lookup. This will lead my program to have good linear time complexity.

<u>Interesting Stuff</u>
